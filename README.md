The fundamental ideas of the Internet of Things and cloud-based data transmission are used in this project. 
Every wearable sensor that the patient uses to assess their body parameters is centrally connected to a NodeMCU (ESP8266), which gathers, transfers, and remotely presents the data via the cloud and application. TCP/IP communications are used to safely transport the data.
